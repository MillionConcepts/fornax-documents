# fornax-documents

This repository contains analytic reports, informational graphics, and documentation produced by Million Concepts for the Space Telescope Science Institute in support of the Fornax project.

Please note that the contents of this repository are currently under review and may be subject to change in the near future.

## contents
* **benchmark_suite_instructions.pdf** -- installation and usage instructions for our FITS cloud access benchmarking suite (https://github.com/fornax-navo/fornax-s3-subsets/tree/main/subset/benchmark)
* **compression comparison.pdf** -- summary report for our study of the photometric effects of RICE tile compression on GALEX images
* **considerations_and_tradeoffs.pdf** -- full-length report of our findings on considerations and tradeoffs for cloud storage-backed cutouts from astronomical data
* **fornax_subset_example_instructions.pdf** -- installation and usage instructions for our FITS cloud access science demo notebooks (e.g. https://github.com/fornax-navo/fornax-s3-subsets/blob/main/subset/ps1_galex_stacking.ipynb)

## authorship
These analyses were co-designed by Michael St. Clair and Chase Million. Chase had primary responsibility for project management and scientific assessment of results. Michael designed and wrote most of the code for the benchmarking suite, science demos, and compression comparison study, with significant support from Chase. He also designed and executed the pipelines for bulk benchmark and compression analysis. Michael and Sierra Brown wrote the considerations and tradeoffs report, with editorial assistance from Chase. Bekah Albach performed photometric analysis of the compression study outputs and wrote the compression comparison report, with assistance from Michael and Chase.
